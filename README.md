# Assignment - Simple Operating System

## Goal
The objective of this assignment is to **simulate key components** of a simple operating system. The simulation focuses on essential mechanisms such as:

* **Scheduler**
* **Synchronization**
* **Memory allocation from virtual to physical memory**

By developing and simulating these components, students will gain a practical understanding of how an operating system manages processes, coordinates concurrency, and handles memory.
